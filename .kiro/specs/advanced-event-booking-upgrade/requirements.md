# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies 13 advanced feature upgrades for the existing Spring Boot 3.2.5 + React 18 vehicle rental system. The existing system (documented in the `vehicle-rental-upgrade` spec) already implements JWT authentication, RBAC (USER/ORGANIZER/ADMIN roles), event CRUD, basic booking/payment models, SSE notifications infrastructure, audit logging, and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS. This upgrade builds on that foundation to deliver: FAQ & Help Center with video tutorials, complete payment and refund management lifecycle, unique human-readable IDs, enriched registration with location data, high-traffic booking queue with pessimistic locking, admin event approval workflow, an admin dashboard, enhanced profile pages, real-time SSE notifications, email notifications, QR-coded tickets with check-in deduplication, and an audit log UI.
